  - "Follow the TypeScript interfaces (ChainAdapter, Transaction, PerpTransaction, FetchOptions) defined in docs/prd.md Section 6"
  - "Follow the Awaken CSV column specs exactly as defined in docs/prd.md Appendix A"
  - "Reference docs/prd.md for detailed requirements, acceptance criteria, and example CSV rows"

  - "Use cursor-pointer on all interactive elements"
  - "Handle API rate limits with exponential backoff (max 3 retries)"
